# Rhyming-Game
My first game made in python, where you have to think up words that rhyme with the selected prompt!

Includes:

- a custom database in the form of text files, so it always remembers your choices
- a custom rhyming checker algorithm
- No imports to download!

What i am planning to add:

- The option to add more ways you think they should rhyme
- a function that checks if you already guessed a word
